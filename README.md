# apod_wallpaper

A client app for the [APOD website](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html). You can also set the pictures of the day as wallpaper. I wrote an article about this application on [medium](https://p-monier96.medium.com/create-your-first-flutter-app-an-apod-cross-platform-application-f3786f5e8cdd)

You can start the app with `flutter run`
